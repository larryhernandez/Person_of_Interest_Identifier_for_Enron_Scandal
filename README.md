# DESCRIPTION

This is a machine learning project in which a binary Support Vector Classifier was developed to identify persons of interest in the Enron Scandal.

# CONTENTS

This repository contains [python code](https://github.com/larryhernandez/Person_of_Interest_Identifier_for_Enron_Scandal/poi_id.py) that utilizes the pandas, numpy, and sklearn modules to develop a binary Support Vector Classifier. Other machine learning methods were tested, including decision tree and random forest, but the SVC performed the best.

# FINAL PRODUCT

The results are summarized in the document [Report.pdf](https://github.com/larryhernandez/Person_of_Interest_Identifier_for_Enron_Scandal/Report.pdf)
